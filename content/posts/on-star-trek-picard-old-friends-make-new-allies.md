I’m not sure what to make of the Picard we’re seeing in Picard. It’s been a few years since I’ve watched much Next Gen, but I can’t help thinking there’s a gap between the way Picard is now, and the way he once was, which I’m struggling to reconcile. To an extent, I believe this gap is intentional. Much of what we’ve seen in these first four episodes has been a commentary on the way Picard looms in the popular consciousness (a figure of compassionate, benevolent authority) and the way such an impression can fail to live up to its own standard. And yet, I can’t shake the feeling that we’re missing some piece of the puzzle to explain how then became now, something more complicated than simply “time.”

## Stray observations

- Speaking of the Borg, I apologize for completely missing the fact that Soji’s de-Borged companion last week was Hugh (Jonathan Del Arco), from the TNG episode “I, Borg.” It’s a smart bit of stunt casting that I really should’ve caught—I don’t think it would’ve changed my thoughts on the episode as a whole, but it was still worth mentioning. Hopefully he’ll pop up again soon.
- There’s not much to say about Seven of Nine at this point, but that’s a terrific entrance.
- Really enjoyed the awkward banter between Dr. Jerati and Rios near the beginning of the episode about the dullness of space travel. I also hope we get more of an explanation about just what’s going on with all of Rios’s holographic programs. It’s a fun quirk, regardless.
- I feel like we need to get to know a bit more about Raffi; right now she’s either raging about Picard or doing exactly what he wants, and while it’s possible to connect the two (in that part of her sarcasm comes from knowing she’ll do exactly what he wants), the character still feels under-defined.
- The warrior nuns who raised Elnor will only agree to help someone if they believe it’s a lost cause; this is a nice reveal at the end of the episode that suggest Picard may be at least a little cognizant of what’s going on than he lets on.
