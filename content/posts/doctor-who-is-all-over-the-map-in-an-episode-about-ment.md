“Can You Hear Me?” starts out incredibly promisingly. The episode opens in 1380 Aleppo, where a spunky young woman named Tahira (Aruhan Galieva) is being treated for mental health issues. The Doctor later notes that 14th century Islamic physicians were known for their enlightened treatment of mental health problems, and I kind of wish this had just been a historical episode about that topic. Particularly at a time when Aleppo is so associated with warfare and destruction, it’s wonderful to see a mainstream TV show celebrate the rich history of the region. Alas, Tahira winds up being a plot device at best and a nonentity at worst. You could remove her from this episode entirely it would barely change a thing. Instead, “Can You Hear Me?” tries to combine spooky nightmare imagery, a serious discussion about mental health, and a heaping helping of ’90s camp. Unsurprisingly, that makes for a rather odd tonal mismatch.

## Stray observations

- This episode features one of the first (if not the first?) cold opens of the season.
- I’m actually not entirely sure why this episode is called “Can You Hear Me?” It opens with a disembodied voice asking that question, but when Rakaya mentally connects with Graham she asks, “Can you see?” I’m also unclear why Graham was the one to receive her psychic message.
- The Doctor has a nightmare vision involving the Timeless Child, who seems to be a young girl on Gallifrey.
- I liked the look of the ape/werewolf monster Tahira willed into existence, although, again, it’s an element of the episode that doesn’t necessarily make a ton of sense plot-wise.
- Sharon D. Clarke makes a brief cameo appearance as a nightmare-version of Grace. Great to see her again!
