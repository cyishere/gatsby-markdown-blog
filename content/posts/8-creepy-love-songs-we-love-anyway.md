**The Beatles** have always held a special place in my heart. My dad even got an album of The Looney Tunes singing Beatles songs for Christmas one year. (Yes, Bugs & Friends Sing The Beatles actually exists.) While I totally respect their drug-induced creations, I’m most fond of The Beatles’ earlier, poppier offerings. Encapsulating the band’s transition from the latter to the former is 1965’s Rubber Soul, which ends with “Run For Your Life.” At first listen, the song sounds like a pleasant follow-up to “I Saw Her Standing There (She Was Just Seventeen),” but as I grew older I realized the song seems more like it should be sung by You’s controlling protagonist, Joe, than bowl-cut Brits wearing skinny black ties. “I’d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man,” Lennon starts off brightly, as though this should be taken as a compliment. “Baby, I’m determined; and I’d rather see you dead.” A request to hold hands, it is not. But it still has a place on my Beatles playlist.
